  abstract = {Djuna Barnes's 1936 novel Nightwood functions as narrative theory or “metafiction” avant le lettre, and as a novel whose narrative practice is shaped by the repeated disruptions of “melancholia.” This warped form of mourning produces compulsive repetition even as it facilitates powerful insights and a new mode of knowing and telling. Barnes let melancholia loose upon her novel's narrative, where it hampers teleological momentum and reveals the problems of novelistic telling: the domination of the narrator, the submission of suffering characters, the compulsions of narrative desire. While Peter Brooks (1984) argues for the persistence of plot and narrative desire in fiction, Barnes interrogates our insistence upon narrated meaning. In Nightwood, Barnes put melancholia to work at the very center of the novel: displacing “proper” narrative form, revealing fundamental compulsions to retell, read, and know.},

  url = {https://www.jstor.org/stable/25614321},
  shorttitle = {Dazzling {{Estrangement}}},
  abstract = {[The reputation of Djuna Barnes's Nightwood as a work of "marginal" modernism is complicated by its affinities with the aesthetics of high modernism, a fact signaled by its role as the inspiration of Joseph Frank's theory of spatial form. At once emblematic and eccentric, the novel is devoted to both recognition and obscurity. Nightwood enacts this paradox through a strategy of queer ekphrasis that aestheticizes moments of loss, giving aesthetic form to experiences of stigma in order to "dazzle" them. Attending to Barnes's spatial form will forward debates about modernism and queer theory, suggesting a more useful vocabulary for both: an account of the aesthetic that is neither wholly subversive nor wholly conservative and a nuanced account of queerness that does not subscribe to either total negation or total affirmation.]},
